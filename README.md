# Nomad

##Prepare and run the app

The project is based on [CocoaPods].(http://cocoapods.org) To prepare the project, take the usual steps for any CocoaPods project.

If you haven't yet, run:
```shell
sudo gem install cocoapods
````

Then:
```shell
pod install
open open Nomad.xcworkspace
```

For testing purposes a Google Places Api key is needed.

Please see here for more info: (https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/#Authentication)[https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/#Authentication]

Once you have obtained your API key search for the string "ADD-YOUR-API-HERE". And replace it with your API key.

Be carefull not to commit your key.
